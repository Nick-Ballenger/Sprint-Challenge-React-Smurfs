1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
Client side routing utilizes the power of modern browsers to allow for a single load of the page. Because all of the routing happens locally it allows for faster page transitions and animations; however, it increases the initial load time and unneeded data may be downloaded.

Server side routing utilizes servers to process routing. Since less data is loaded initially the initial load time can be much quicker. But the tradeoff for that is choppier transitions and full page reload for every request
